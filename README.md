# Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition using OpenCV and Deepface
![B7A63B4C-78C4-41B5-8C70-0302CAF84C6D_1_105_c](https://github.com/ajitharunai/Facial-Emotion-Recognition-with-OpenCV-and-Deepface/assets/89124776/0147d40a-43a1-4f65-9747-bca0d7456310)

This project demonstrates the implementation of real-time facial emotion recognition using the `deepface` library and OpenCV. The objective is to capture live video from a webcam, identify faces within the video stream, and predict the corresponding emotions for each detected face. The emotions predicted are displayed in real-time on the video frames.

To streamline this process, we've utilized the `deepface` library, a deep learning-based facial analysis tool that employs pre-trained models for accurate emotion detection. TensorFlow is the underlying framework for the deep learning operations. Additionally, we leverage OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to facilitate image and video processing.

## Instructions

### Initial Setup:

1. Clone the repository: Execute `git clone https://github.com/ajitharunai/Facial-Emotion-Recognition-with-OpenCV-and-Deepface/`.

2. Navigate to the project directory: Run `cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface`.

3. Install required dependencies:
   - Option 1: Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Option 2: Install dependencies individually:
     - `pip install deepface`
     - `pip install opencv-python`

4. Obtain the Haar cascade XML file for face detection:
   - Download the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file from the [OpenCV GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

5. Execute the code:
   - Run the Python script.
   - The webcam will activate, initiating real-time facial emotion detection.
   - Emotion labels will be superimposed onto the frames containing recognized faces.

## Approach

1. Import Essential Libraries: Import `cv2` for video capture and image processing, as well as `deepface` for the emotion detection model.

2. Load Haar Cascade Classifier: Utilize `cv2.CascadeClassifier()` to load the XML file for face detection.

3. Video Capture Initialization: Employ `cv2.VideoCapture()` to initiate video capture from the default webcam.

4. Frame Processing Loop: Enter a continuous loop to process each video frame.

5. Grayscale Conversion: Transform each frame into grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()`.

6. Face Detection: Detect faces within the grayscale frame using `face_cascade.detectMultiScale()`.

7. Face Region Extraction: For each detected face, extract the Region of Interest (ROI) containing the face.

8. Preprocessing: Prepare the face image for emotion detection by employing the built-in preprocessing function from the `deepface` library.

9. Emotion Prediction: Utilize the pre-trained emotion detection model provided by the `deepface` library to predict emotions.

10. Emotion Labeling: Map the predicted emotion index to the corresponding emotion label.

11. Visual Annotation: Draw rectangles around the detected faces and label them with the predicted emotions via `cv2.rectangle()` and `cv2.putText()`.

12. Display Output: Present the resulting frame with the labeled emotion using `cv2.imshow()`.

13. Loop Termination: If the 'q' key is pressed, exit the loop.

14. Cleanup: Release video capture resources and close all windows with `cap.release()` and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`.

Sure, let's break down the code step by step:

1. Import required libraries:

```python
import cv2
from deepface import DeepFace
```

- `cv2` is the OpenCV library used for computer vision and image processing.
- `DeepFace` is a class from the `deepface` library used for building and using facial analysis models.

2. Load the pre-trained emotion detection model:

```python
model = DeepFace.build_model("Emotion")
```

- This line creates an instance of the pre-trained emotion detection model provided by the `deepface` library.

3. Define emotion labels:

```python
emotion_labels = ['angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'sad', 'surprise', 'neutral']
```

- A list of emotion labels corresponding to the detected emotions.

4. Load face cascade classifier:

```python
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
```

- Loads the Haar cascade classifier for face detection provided by OpenCV.

5. Start capturing video:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```

- Initializes video capture from the default webcam (camera index 0).

6. Main Loop:

```python
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    gray_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_frame, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
```

- The loop continuously captures frames from the webcam (`cap.read()`), converts them to grayscale (`cv2.cvtColor()`), and detects faces within the grayscale frame using the Haar cascade classifier (`face_cascade.detectMultiScale()`).

7. Face Processing Loop:

```python
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    face_roi = gray_frame[y:y + h, x:x + w]
    resized_face = cv2.resize(face_roi, (48, 48), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
    normalized_face = resized_face / 255.0
    reshaped_face = normalized_face.reshape(1, 48, 48, 1)
    preds = model.predict(reshaped_face)[0]
    emotion_idx = preds.argmax()
    emotion = emotion_labels[emotion_idx]
    cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 0, 255), 2)
    cv2.putText(frame, emotion, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (0, 0, 255), 2)
```

- For each detected face, this block of code processes the face:
  - Extracts the Region of Interest (ROI) of the face.
  - Resizes the face to match the input size of the emotion detection model.
  - Normalizes the resized face image.
  - Reshapes the image for model input.
  - Makes emotion predictions using the pre-trained model.
  - Draws a rectangle around the face and labels it with the predicted emotion using OpenCV functions.

8. Display and Exit:

```python
cv2.imshow('Real-time Emotion Detection', frame)
if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
    break
```

- Displays the frame with labeled emotions using `cv2.imshow()`. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point the loop is exited.

9. Cleanup:

```python
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- Releases the video capture and closes all windows.

In summary, this code captures real-time video from the webcam, detects faces, predicts emotions using a pre-trained model, and displays the processed frames with labeled emotions. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point the program is terminated.
